# sonicpi-in-toolbox-dockerfile
Tiny repository to host a configuration to get sonicpi running with toolbox.

It's basically the official installation steps from sonicpi packed in a docker container.

It turned out that running a GUI application with graphic and sound could be really hard to get running on a host system.

Therefore I use now toolbox (based on podman containers) to get sonicpi running.
(It does all the hard permission tweaking for getting GUI and sound running for me)
